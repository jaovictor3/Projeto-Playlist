                <p>Roll one and up hit this magic (yeah)
                    With the gang, we ball out, it could get tragic (let's go)
                    All we got, we gon' let you niggas have it (woo, woo)
                    Stuck in my ways, think I need to change my habits (woo, woo)
                    What would you do if you were me and didn't have shit? (Yeah)
                    Look in the mirror, now I'm feeling like a savage (let's go)
                    Tell my son I love him, for him, I'ma make it happen (woo, woo)

                    Livin' in a dream, now my music they be blasting (yeah)
                    Step out, I'm a star, always in the latest fashion
                    Had to set the bar, niggas try to catch me lacking
                    Bank account for my son, he won't have to struggle
                    You can see it in my eyes, all I do is hustle
                    They tried to knock me off my feet, I'm ready to rumble
                    Feel like I ain't ate in weeks, workin' off the muscle
                    Oh yeah, oh my, we ride
                    For my brothers no lie
                    All you niggas can die
                    Never wrong, they right
                    I ain't changing my side
                    Yeah, we in it for life

                    Ayy, how could you lie to my face?
                    People claim that they be loyal, they be takin' up space
                    See my broski lose his heart when he was fightin' that case
                    Took so many L's, I'm not going back to those days
                    I'ma treat you how you treat me, do you like how it tastes?
                    Shawty, you's a one nighter, can't treat you like my ace
                    I got way too many problems to be worried, I'm straight
                    Me and Craig selling weed, had to watch for the jakes
                    On the road, this shit crazy, I get eighty a show
                    Save my money, stack it up, it look like I'm sellin' dope
                    Foreign cars, driving fast, I've never done this before
                    Get high, drown out my problems, let me pour me a four (yeah)
