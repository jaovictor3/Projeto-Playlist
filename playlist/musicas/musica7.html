                    Ayy, wild things you're doin' at night
                    Trips to wherever feels right
                    Doin' it all just to feel things
                    Drinking's enough of a vice
                    Drugs just aren't suiting you righ
                    You were just fine as a real thing, thing

                    You, you, you know
                    That's not the way to get over me
                    I don't know what you're sayin'

                    I can't recover from our last conversation
                    You called me weak
                    And you tested my manhood as we yelled at each other
                    You wanted me to gon' put my hands on you
                    Just to show you I love you
                    You know I can't jeopardize both our reputations
