                    Just like the land that bear the name Africa
Love is on my mind
It's for everyone no matter where you're from
Love, it cross all lines
Like the feeling of all the seasons changing
Love is a memory
In these last days, when iniquity blazing
Truth love speaks
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    True love
                    How do you know, what you mean to me
                    True love
                    Where does it show as I live and I breath
                    True love
                    In the valley of the shadow
                    I know that you'll be
                    (True love) I defense, I conquer death and I conquer the enemy

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    What is love really if it only affects, one aspect of life?
That's like a musician who only accepts, his own musical type
That's like a preacher who only respects Sunday morning, and not Saturday night
That's how the soldier can come to reflect
That love is more than a man and a wife, I mean

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I need true love
Where do you know it, well what you doin' to me (true love)
And does it show as I live and I breath (true love)
In the valley of the shadow, I know you'll be
I defense, I conquer death and I conquer envy
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In a time of plenty, Jah gonna keep I strong
                    Things get how and I keep cool, yeah
                    Jah gonna keep me strong
                    When InI cup is empty
                    Jah gonna keep I strong
                    When InI cup is full, yeah
                    Jah keep I from their temptation, come one
                    True love
                    Babe do you know what, what you mean to me
                    True love
                    Where does it show as I live and I breath
                    True love
                    In the valley of the shadow-dow
                    You'll be
                    (True love) I defense, I conquer death and I conquer the enemy
